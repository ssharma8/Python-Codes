# Stata_Corruption_Codes
The markup_codes provides a code sample for STATA. In all sections, I use probit models to derive the results. Essentially, the models test whether competition at the firm-level plays an important role in determining the firms likelihood to bribe public officials.
The data is  obtained from the World Bank Enterprise Survey from 2006-2010.
